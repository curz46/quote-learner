const ge = `== Pip
"the small bundle of shivers growing afraid of it all and beginning to cry, was Pip"
"I was a common labouring-boy; that my hands were coarse, that my boots were thick"
"I wish Joe had been rather more genteelly brought up, and then I should have been so too."
"'Biddy,' said I, after binding her to secrecy, 'I want to be a gentleman.'"
"Not with pleasure, though I was bound to him by so many times; no; with considerable disturbance, some mortification, and a keen sense of incongruity."
"I did really cry in good earnest when I went to bed, to think that my expectations had done some good to somebody."
== Joe
"He was a mild, good-natured, sweet-tempered, easy-going, foolish, dear fellow - a sort of Hercules in strength, and also in weakness."
"'And bring the poor little child. God bless the poor little child,' I said to your sister, 'there's room for him at the forge!'"
"'I'm wrong in these clothes. I'm wrong out of the forge, the kitchen, or off h'meshes."
"'Pip, old chap, you knowed her when she were a fine figure of a -' and clasped my hand and said no more."
"'Which dear old Pip, old chap,' said Joe, 'you and me was ever friends. And when you're well enough to go out for a ride - what larks!'"
== Miss Havisham
"She was dressed in rich materials...all of white."
"everything within my view which ought to be white, had been white long ago, and had lost its lustre, and was faded and yellow."
"waxwork and skeleton seemed to have dark eyes that moved and looked at me."
"'If she favours you, love her. If she wounds you, love her. If she tears your heart to pieces - and is gets older and stronger, it will tear deeper - love her, love her, love her!'"
"'Estella, Estella, Estella, to be proud and hard to me!'"
"'Oh!' she cried, despairingly. 'What have I done! What have I done!'"
"'When she first came, I meant to save her from misery like mine.'"
== Estella
"She put the mug down on the stones of the yard, and gave me the bread and meat without looking at me, as insolently as if I were a dog in disgrace."
"she slapped my face with such force as she had, when I answered it. 'Now?' Said she. 'You coarse little monster, what do you think of me now?"
"'You must know ... that I have no heart ... I have no softness there, no - sympathy - sentiment"
"'I am what you have made me. Take all the praise, take all the blame; take all the success, take all the failure; in short, take me'"
"'I don't care for what you say at all. I have tried to warn you of this; now, have I not?'"
"'I have been bent and broken, but - I hope - into a better shape.'"
== Magwitch
"A fearful man, all in coarse grey, with a great iron on his lag."
"'You young dog,' said the man, licking his lips, 'what fat cheeks you ha' got.'"
"Master"
"'Yes, Pip, dear boy, I've made a gentleman on you! ... I swore arterwards, sure as ever I spec'lated and got rich, you should get rich.'"
"'I'm you're second father. You're my son - more to me nor any son."
"he raised my hand to his lips."
== Jaggers
"The strange gentleman, with an air of authority not to be disputed, and with a manner expressive of knowing something secret about every one of us that would effectually do for each individual if he chose to disclose it"
"Mr Jagger's own high-backed chair was of deadly horsehair, with rows of brass nails round it, like a coffin"
"he seemed to bully his very sandwich as he ate it)
"He was a thousand times better informed and cleverer than Wemmick, and yet I would a thousand times rather have had Wemmick to dinner."
== Mrs Joe
"she had brought me up 'by hand'"
"She was tall and bony, and almost always wore a coarse apron"
"she pounced on Joe, and, taking him by the two whiskers, knocked his head for a little while against the wall behind him"
"she wanted him to sit down close to her, and wanted me to put her arms round his neck. So I put them round his neck, and she laid her head down in his shoulder quite content and satisfied."
== Herbert Pocket
"His spirit inspired me with great respect."
"Herbert Pocket had a frank and easy way with him that was very taking."
"a natural incapacity to do anything secret and mean."
"he would never be very successful or rich."
"He offered these friendly suggestions in such a lively way, that we both laughed and I scarcely blushed."
"no varnish can hide the grain of the wood; and that the more varnish you put on, the more the grain will express itself."
"the radiant face with which he came home one afternoon"
"his hopes grew stronger and his face brighter"
== Drummle
"he struck me a sulky kind of fellow"
"the first Finch I saw ... was Bentley Drummle: at that time floundering about town in a cab of his own, and doing a great deal of damage to the posts at the street corners."
"I had heard of the death of her husband, from an accident consequent on his ill-treatment of a horse."
== Wemmick
"'my guiding-star always is "Get hold of portable property.'"
"'However, this is not London talk."
== Society/Class
"I wish Joe had been more genteelly brought up, and then I should have been so too."
"I wanted to make Joe less ignorant and common, that he might be worthier of my society and less open to Estella's reproach."
"'Biddy,' said I, after binding her to secrecy, 'I want to be a gentleman.'"
"'I'm wrong in these clothes. I'm wrong out of the forge, the kitchen, or off h'meshes."
"The Finches of the Grove: ... the members should dine expensively once a fortnight, to quarrel among themselves ... and to cause six waiters to get drunk on the stairs."
"We spent as much money as we could ... We were always more or less miserable"
== Ambitions
"Whenever I watched the vessels standing out to sea with their white sails spread, I somehow thought of Miss Havisham and Estella; ... Miss Havisham and Estella and the strange house and the strange life appeared to have something to do with everything that was picturesque."
"She had adopted Estella, she had as good as adopted me, and it could not fail to be her intention to bring us together. She reserved it for me to ... in short, do all the shining deeds of the young Knight of romance, and marry the Princess."
"I thought of the beautiful young Estella, proud and refined, coming towards me, and I thought with absolute abhorrence of the contrast between the jail and her."
"Miss Havisham's intentions towards me, all a mere dream; Estella not designed for me; I only suffered in Satis House as a convenience, a sting for the greedy relations, a model with a mechanical heart to practise on when no other practice was at hand; those were the first smarts I had."
"It would have been cruel in Miss Havisham, horribly cruel, to practise on the susceptibility of a poor boy, and to torture me through all these years with a vain hope and an idle pursuit, if she had reflected on the gravity of what she did. But I think she did not."
== Gender
"she pounced on Joe, and, taking him by the two whiskers, knocked his head for a little while against the wall behind him"
"the bride within the bridal dress had withered like the dress ... the figure upon which it now hung loose, had shrunk to skin and bone ... waxwork and skeleton seemed to have dark eyes that moved and looked at me."
"she wanted him to sit down close to her, and wanted me to put her arms round his neck. So I put them round his neck, and she laid her head down in his shoulder quite content and satisfied."
"The sky was blue, the larks were soaring high over the green corn, I thought that all country-side more beautiful and peaceful by far than I had ever known it to be yet."
"The schoolhouse where Biddy was mistress"
"'It's my wedding day,' cried Biddy, in a burst of happiness, 'and I am married to Joe!'"
== Justice
"He was a mild, good-natured, sweet-tempered, easy-going, foolish, dear fellow - a sort of Hercules in strength, and also in weakness."
"'If she favours you, love her. If she wounds you, love her. If she tears your heart to pieces - and is gets older and stronger, it will tear deeper - love her, love her, love her!'"
"the first Finch I saw ... was Bentley Drummle: at that time floundering about town in a cab of his own, and doing a great deal of damage to the posts at the street corners."
"'Yes, Pip, dear boy, I've made a gentleman on you! ... I swore arterwards, sure as ever I spec'lated and got rich, you should get rich.'"
"The sky was blue, the larks were soaring high over the green corn, I thought that all country-side more beautiful and peaceful by far than I had ever known it to be yet."
"'I have been bent and broken, but - I hope - into a better shape.'"
== Violence
"'what fat cheeks you ha' got ... Darn me if I couldn't eat 'em'"
"she had brought me up 'by hand'"
"she pounced on Joe, and, taking him by the two whiskers, knocked his head for a little while against the wall behind him"
"the first Finch I saw ... was Bentley Drummle: at that time floundering about town in a cab of his own, and doing a great deal of damage to the posts at the street corners."
== Learning
"He offered these friendly suggestions in such a lively way, that we both laughed and I scarcely blushed."
"We spent as much money as we could ... We were always more or less miserable"
"I could not have spoken one word, though it had been to save my life. ... I seemed to be suffocating"`

== Social Class
"You ought to like this port, Gerald."
"There's a fair chance that I might find my way into the next Honours List."

"I went to the manager at Milwards and I told him that if they didn't get rid of that girl, I'd never go near the place again and I'd persuade mother to close our account with them."
"there'll be a public scandal - unless we're lucky - and who here will suffer from that more than I will?"

"Nothing to do with you, Sheila. Run along."
"She's had a long, exciting and tiring day"
"she was pretty and a good sport"

== Change
"Probably a Socialist or some sort of crank"

"Fire and blood and anguish."
"What about this ring?"
"No, not yet. It's too soon. I must think."
== Power
"I might find my way into the next Honours List. Just a knighthood, of course."
"Perhaps I ought to warn you that he's an old friend of mine, and that I see him fairly frequently. We play golf together"
"I went to the manager at Milwards and I told him that if they didn't get rid of that girl, I'd never go near the place again and I'd persuade mother to close our account with them."
"I know. Somehow he makes you."
"I suppose it was inevitable. She was young and pretty and warm-hearted - and intensely grateful."

"If we were all responsible for everything that happened to everybody we'd had anything to do with, it would be very awkward, wouldn't it?"
"So I'm really responsible?"
"I want you to understand that I didn't install her there so that I could make love to her."
"I consider I did my duty."
"We are members of one body. We are responsible for each other."
